an approximate and conversational way.

** Usage

Times are read from standard input and should be separated by
whitespace.

#+BEGIN_SRC
$ echo 8:39 | fuzzyclock
twenty to nine
$ echo 15:22:57 | fuzzyclock
twenty past three
$ echo 0 | fuzzyclock
twelve

quarter past one
$ echo 19:10 20:53 21:36 | fuzzyclock
ten past seven
five to nine
twenty-five to ten
